### Bugs discovered: 
#### Solved bugs

1. **Flash messages not displaying**
   - None of the flash messages were displaying when logging in and out. 
   - Flash messages were hidden by the navbar. 
   - To fix this I increased the top margin of the flash messages, so that they appeared below the navbar. 
  
    ```css
    .alert {
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: #f44336;
  color: white;
  opacity: 1;
  transition: 0.6s;
  margin-top: 90px;
  width: 30%;
  text-align: center;
  left: 35%;
}
    ```

2. **When running the app.py file the js file was displaying a 404 error in the terminal**
   - When running the app.py file I was getting the following message in the terminal `J"GET /%7Burl_for('static',%20filename='js/script.js')%20%7D%7D HTTP/1.1" 404`
   - The js link at the bottom of the base.html page was missing a curly bracket. When this was added the 404 error disappeared. 

3. **Alert boxes displaying flash messages won't close when the x icon is clicked**
   - Any time a flash messaged displayed, I was unable to close it. 
   - To fix this bug I added the following on click function `onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none';"` to the alert box button. 

   ```html
   <div class="alert success flashes">
            <span class="closebtn" onclick="this.parentElement.style.display='none';">&times;</span>
            <strong>{{ message }}</strong>
        </div>
    ```

4. **Modals are not updating with the correct book content**
   - When each of the book modals are clicked on, they are all appearing with the first books' content on not their own content. 
   - To fix this I gave each books' modal button a unique data-bs-target that matched the modal's id.  

5. **A book was added to the database, but was not displaying on the members profile**
   - When adding a book via the Add book page, it would display the flash message 'Book successfully added', but was not displaying on 
     the members profile. I checked the database to ensure the data had been added, and it had. 
   - This bug was fixed by changing the href in the Your picks page to access the username instead of the book_name when displaying the 
     book's image. 

     From 

 ```html
 <a href="{{ url_for('your_picks', book_name=your_picks._id) }}"></a>
 ```
    to 

 ```html
 <a href="{{ url_for('your_picks', username=your_picks._id) }}"></a>
 ```

6. **The author's name was not displaying in the book modals**
   - When opening the book modals, none of the author's names were displaying. When I checked the database 'null' was displayed next to
     author_name. 
   - In the Add book template, book_author was used in the label, name and id, instead of author_name. Once this was changed, the authors'
     names were displaying in the modals.  

7. **Horizontal scroll present on home page**
   - To fix this bug, the footer was deleted from the home page template, as the home page was extended from the base template, which already
     included the footer. 

8. **Your picks page and modal displaying incorrect names of the members who added books**
   - If a book was uploaded by another member, it does not display that members name on the Your picks page or in the modal. Instead,
     it displays the name of the member logged in. 
   - This bug was fixed by changing `{{ username }}â€™s review` which displayed the name of whoever was logged in, to 
     `{{ your_picks.created_by }}'s review`, which displays the name of the member who added the book. 

9. **When deleting a book, the incorrect book was deleted**
   - When deleting a book, the previous book added by a member was deleted, whether it was their book they uploaded or another member's book. 
   - This bug was fixed by appending {{ your_picks._id }} to the delete modal button's data-bs-target and the delete modal's id. 

```html
 <!-- Modal button for Delete Book modal -->
                    <button class="btn btn-danger" data-bs-target="#modal-delete{{ your_picks._id }}"
                        data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Delete</button>
```

```html
<!-- Modal for Delete Book -->
    <div class="modal fade" id="modal-delete{{ your_picks._id }}" tabindex="-1" aria-hidden="true">
        <div class="modal-dialog">
```

10. **The background color on the home page not stretching the full browser width**
    - This bug was fixed by adding the container-fluid class to the <main> element in the base.html page and deleting all container classes
      in the other templates.
