[The Bookshelf](https://the-bookshelf-milestone.herokuapp.com/) was designed, built, and deployed, by myself, Michelle Newell as the 
third project for the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development diploma. The purpose of The Bookshelf is to be an online book club 
that allows members to view The Bookshelf’s monthly recommendations, as well as provide and share book recommendations of the users 
own liking. The website is designed to share literary experiences, specifically for those looking for book suggestions and wanting to 
share their own books that they have enjoyed.
