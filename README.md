[The Bookshelf](https://the-bookshelf-milestone.herokuapp.com/) was designed, built, and deployed, by myself, Michelle Newell as the 
third project for the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development diploma. The purpose of The Bookshelf is to be an online book club 
that allows members to view The Bookshelf’s monthly recommendations, as well as provide and share book recommendations of the users 
own liking. The website is designed to share literary experiences, specifically for those looking for book suggestions and wanting to 
share their own books that they have enjoyed.

## Design Choices

The Bookshelf has a very relaxed and fun feel to it, with emphasis on displaying books in an easy to see manner. The following 
design choices were made bearing this in mind:

### Fonts
- The primary font 'exo' was chosen to be the main text of this site as it is simple, and looks professional. 

- The secondary font 'Roboto' was chosen for the main headings as it is very popular, looks professional, and styles well in both 
lower and uppercase.

### Icons
- Very few icons were used, as to avoid overcrowding. 
- The **envelope** icon was placed next to the site owners email address to make it stand out, and to make it's purpose clear when 
  doing a quick glance.
- The **phone** icon was placed next to the site owners phone number to make it standout, and to make it's purpose clear when doing 
  a quick glance. 
- The **Facebook logo** icon, **Instagram logo** icon, **LinkedIn logo** icon, and **GitHub logo** icon are included in the footer 
  to lead visitors to the site owners social media accounts.

### Colours
- bright pink: #FF1493
- purple: #FF00FF
- green: #32CD32
- bright green:#00FF00
- blue: #00BFFF
- bright blue: #40CCFF
- white: #f4f4f4

- The bright contrasting colors were chosen for this website because they standout on the dark background, which helps highlight 
  important information. The bright colors also add an element of fun to the website.
