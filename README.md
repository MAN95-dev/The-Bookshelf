[The Bookshelf](https://the-bookshelf-milestone.herokuapp.com/) was designed, built, and deployed, by myself, Michelle Newell as the third project for the Code Institute Full 
Stack Web Development diploma. The purpose of The Bookshelf is to be an online book club that allows members to view The Bookshelfâ€™s 
monthly recommendations, as well as provide and share book recommendations of the users own liking. The website is designed to share 
literary experiences, specifically for those looking for book suggestions and wanting to share their own books that they have enjoyed.
