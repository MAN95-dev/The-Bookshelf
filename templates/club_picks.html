                                <p>From the author of The House of the Spirits, this epic novel spanning decades and
                                    crossing continents follows two young people as they flee the aftermath of the
                                    Spanish
                                    Civil War in search of a place to call home. In the late 1930s, civil war grips
                                    Spain.

                                <p>Two refugees from the Spanish Civil War cross the Atlantic Ocean to Chile and a
                                    half-century of political and personal upheavals.We meet Victor Dalmau and Roser
                                    Bruguera in 1938 as it is becoming increasingly clear that the Republican cause
                                    they support is doomed. When they reunite in France as penniless refugees, Roser
                                    has survived a harrowing flight across the Pyrenees while heavily pregnant and
                                    given birth to the son of Victor’s brother Guillem, killed at the Battle of the
                                    Ebro. Victor, evacuated with the wounded he was tending in a makeshift hospital,
                                    learns of a ship outfitted by poet Pablo Neruda to take exiles to a new life in
                                    Chile, but he and Roser must marry in order to gain a berth. Allende (In the Midst
                                    of Winter, 2017, etc.) expertly sets up this forced intimacy between two very
                                    different people: Resolute, realistic Roser never looks back and doggedly pursues
                                    a musical career in Chile while Victor, despite being fast-tracked into medical
                                    school by socialist politician Salvador Allende (a relative of the author's),
                                    remains melancholy and nostalgic for his homeland. Their platonic affection deepens
                                    into physical love and lasting commitment in an episodic narrative that reaches a
                                    catastrophic climax with the 1973 coup overthrowing Chile’s democratically elected
                                    government. For Victor and Roser, this is a painful reminder of their losses in
                                    Spain and the start of new suffering. The wealthy, conservative del Solar family
                                    provides a counterpoint to the idealistic Dalmaus; snobbish, right-wing patriarch
                                    Isidro and his hysterically religious wife, Laura, verge on caricature, but Allende
                                    paints more nuanced portraits of eldest son Felipe, who smooths the refugees’ early
                                    days in Chile, and daughter Ofelia, whose brief affair with Victor has lasting
                                    consequences. Allende tends to describe emotions and events rather than delve into
                                    them, and she paints the historical backdrop in very broad strokes, but she is an
                                    engaging storyteller. A touching close in 1994 brings one more surprise and
                                    unexpected
                                    hope for the future to 80-year-old Victor.A trifle facile, but this decades-spanning
                                    drama is readable and engrossing throughout.

                                <p>Two struggling authors spend the summer writing and falling in love in a quaint beach
                                    town.
                                    January Andrews has just arrived in the small town of North Bear Shores with some
                                    serious
                                    baggage. Her father has been dead for a year, but she still hasn’t come to terms
                                    with what
                                    she found out at his funeral—he had been cheating on her mother for years. January
                                    plans to
                                    spend the summer cleaning out and selling the house her father and “That Woman”
                                    lived in
                                    together. But she’s also a down-on-her-luck author facing writer’s block, and she no
                                    longer
                                    believes in the happily-ever-after she’s made the benchmark of her work. Her
                                    steadily dwindling
                                    bank account, though, is a daily reminder that she must sell her next book, and
                                    fast.
                                    Serendipitously, she discovers that her new next-door neighbor is Augustus Everett,
                                    the darling
                                    of the literary fiction set and her former college rival/crush. Gus also happens to
                                    be struggling
                                    with his next book (and some serious trauma that unfolds throughout the novel).
                                    Though the two
                                    get off to a rocky start, they soon make a bet: Gus will try to write a romance
                                    novel, and January
                                    will attempt “bleak literary fiction.” They spend the summer teaching each other the
                                    art of their
                                    own genres—January takes Gus on a romantic outing to the local carnival; Gus takes
                                    January to the
                                    burned-down remains of a former cult—and they both process their own grief, loss,
                                    and trauma through
                                    this experiment. There are more than enough steamy scenes to sustain the slow-burn
                                    romance, and smart
                                    commentary on the placement and purpose of “women’s fiction” joins with crucial
                                    conversations about
                                    mental health to add multiple intriguing layers to the plot.

                                    distance — and
                                    Papi's secrets — the two girls are forced to face a new reality in which their
                                    father is dead
                                    and their lives are forever altered.

                                <p>A novel-in-verse that explores the intricacies of love and mourning. Clap When You
                                    Land tells
                                    the story of Camino and Yahaira, two sisters whose fates become intertwined when a
                                    tragic
                                    accident forces them to discover the truth about their father—and each other. On the
                                    day of
                                    her father’s arrival to the Dominican Republic, Camino Rios skips a math test to go
                                    to the
                                    airport, where she finds a group of people crowded around a TV screen. Across the
                                    pond in New
                                    York, Yahaira Rios is called into her school’s main office where her mother,
                                    red-eyed and
                                    weeping, awaits with news: Her father’s plane has crashed, and there are no
                                    survivors. As the
                                    sisters —who are unaware of one another’s existence—grapple with their grief and
                                    attempt to
                                    navigate a world without their father, they uncover their families’ long-kept
                                    secrets and
                                    eventually find their way to each other. Clap When You Land is an affecting novel,
                                    one that
                                    portrays themes of grief, sexual assault, sisterhood, betrayal, cultural identity,
                                    and family
                                    with great care and empathy. It is written in alternating points of view, a
                                    technique that allows
                                    for a thorough exploration of the protagonists’ inner lives. Heartfelt and raw,
                                    Acevedo’s verse is
                                    deft at sifting through the complicated emotions that arise in the wake of great
                                    loss, and particularly
                                    poignant in those moments when it is not afraid to linger on the characters’
                                    imperfections. A powerful
                                    and vibrant work that will leave you thinking long after you’ve put it down.

                                    City by Sarah J. Maas is the book for you. This novel was masterfully written to the
                                    point that
                                    I'm sitting here debating rereading it like one might rewatch their favorite movie
                                    because I can't
                                    get enough. Bryce Quinlan and Hunt Athalar are unforgettable characters you will
                                    fall madly in
                                    love with. You will laugh at all the witty banter and cry with each of these beloved
                                    characters.
                                    My only advice to fellow readers is to push past the first 60 pages and you won't
                                    regret it.
                                    Crescent City is the first book in this series and I will be counting the hours
                                    until the second
                                    is released!

                                <p>From Blood and Ash starts off really slow. Like mind-numbingly slow. There’s a huge
                                    info-dump in
                                    chapter 1, very little dialogue, and not a lot happening. That is until the final
                                    sentence of
                                    Chapter 1. Then JLA provides just the right hook not to lose me. From Blood and Ash
                                    gets a lot
                                    of rave reviews from my Facebook group and I knew I had to stick with it and give

                                    somewhere around the
                                    40% mark, and by the end of Chapter 25 I was addicted, hook, line, and sinker. While
                                    I spent 6 days
                                    reading the first 40%, the last 60% was finished in a single 6-hour long reading
                                    session. I could not
                                    put the book down.

                                <p>Writers & Lovers is a book about passion, desire, grief, determination, and finding
                                    one's way.
                                    It's also about craving love, family, and success. And it's about learning to stop
                                    worrying so
                                    much about how men "are perceiving you, at the great expense of what you yourself
                                    are feeling
                                    about them."

                                <p>A Boston-area waitress manages debt, grief, medical troubles, and romantic
                                    complications as she
                                    finishes her novel. “There are so many things I can’t think about in order to write
                                    in the
                                    morning,” Casey explains at the opening of King’s (Euphoria, 2014, etc.) latest. The
                                    top three
                                    are her mother’s recent death, her crushing student loans, and the married poet she
                                    recently had
                                    a steaming-hot affair with at a writer’s colony. But having seen all but one of her
                                    writer friends
                                    give up on the dream, 31-year-old Casey is determined to stick it out. After those
                                    morning hours
                                    at her desk in her teensy garage apartment, she rides her banana bike to work at a
                                    restaurant in
                                    Harvard Square—a setting the author evokes in delicious detail, recalling Stephanie
                                    Danler’s
                                    Sweetbitter, though with a lighter touch. Casey has no sooner resolved to forget the
                                    infidel poet
                                    than a few more writers show up on her romantic radar. She rejects a guy at a party
                                    who reveals he’s
                                    only written 11 1/2 pages in three years—“That kind of thing is contagious”—to find
                                    herself torn
                                    between a widowed novelist with two young sons and a guy with an irresistible broken
                                    tooth from the
                                    novelist's workshop. Casey was one of the top two golfers in the country when she
                                    was 14, and the
                                    mystery of why she gave up the sport altogether is entangled with the mystery of her
                                    estrangement
                                    from her father, the latter theme familiar from King’s earlier work. In fact, with
                                    its young
                                    protagonist, its love triangle, and its focus on literary ambition, this charmingly
                                    written
                                    coming-of-age story would be an impressive debut novel. But after the originality
                                    and impact of
                                    Euphoria, it might feel a bit slight.

                                <p>disturbing look at the unrealistic beauty standards placed on Korean women. Cha's
                                    timely debut deftly
                                    explores the impact of impossible beauty standards and male-dominated family money
                                    on South Korean
                                    women. Kyuri, Miho, Ara, and Sujin are two sets of working-class roommates who
                                    befriend each other,
                                    and Wonna is a married woman who lives on a different floor of the same apartment
                                    complex in Seoul.
                                    All are struggling financially. As Wonna laments, "Unless you are born into a
                                    chaebol family or your
                                    parents were the fantastically lucky few who purchased land in Gangnam decades ago,
                                    you have to work
                                    and work and work for a salary that isn't even enough to buy a house...." Because of
                                    Kyuri's successful
                                    plastic surgeries, men hire her to be their companion at after-work "room salons,"
                                    giving her an enviable
                                    stock of designer purses and spending money. Sujin is saving up for surgery to
                                    attain the same face as
                                    Kyuri, but Cha shows how all the women are impacted by these standards. Ara's work

                                    her literally invested in part of the beauty industry, and even though artist Miho
                                    hopes her talent will
                                    allow her to rise on her own, she finds herself dependent on the whims of a wealthy
                                    boyfriend. At times,
                                    the voices of the many characters can blur and the timeline can be confusing. Wonna
                                    is the least developed
                                    character and interacts with the others only in a plot twist at the end of the book.
                                    However, taken together,
                                    Cha's empathetic portraits allow readers to see the impact of economic inequity,
                                    entrenched classism, and
                                    patriarchy on her hard-working characters' lives. Cha grew up in the United States,
                                    South Korea, and Hong
                                    Kong and is a former Seoul-based culture and travel editor for CNN.

                                <p> After acing a job interview and accepting a marriage proposal, Dannie Kohan has had
                                    the perfect day.
                                    That is, until she awakens to find herself five years in the future with a
                                    completely different man.
                                    Just one hour in that alternate reality shakes Dannie to her core. After all, highly
                                    ambitious Dannie
                                    and her boyfriend, David, have plotted out their lives in minute detail, and the
                                    sexy man in her
                                    dream—was it a dream?—is most certainly not in the script. Serle (The Dinner List,
                                    2018) deftly spins
                                    these magical threads into Dannie’s perfectly structured life, leaving not only
                                    Dannie, but also the
                                    reader wondering whether Dannie time traveled or hallucinated. Her best friend,
                                    Bella, would delight
                                    in the story given that she thinks Dannie is much too straight-laced, and some spicy
                                    dreaming might
                                    push Dannie to find someone more passionate than David. Unfortunately, glamorous
                                    Bella is in Europe
                                    with her latest lover. Ever pragmatic, Dannie consults her therapist, who almost
                                    concurs that it was
                                    likely a dream, and throws herself into her work. Pleased to have landed the job at
                                    a prestigious
                                    law firm, Dannie easily loses her worries in litigation. Soon four and a half years
                                    have passed with
                                    no wedding date set, and Bella is back in the U.S. with a new man in her life. A man
                                    who turns out to
                                    be literally the man of Dannie’s dream. The sheer fact of Aaron Gregory’s existence
                                    forces Dannie to
                                    reevaluate her trust in the laws of physics as well as her decision to marry David,
                                    a decision that
                                    seems less believable with each passing day. And as the architecture of Dannie’s
                                    overplanned life
                                    disintegrates, Serle twists and twines the remnants of her dream into a surprising
                                    future.

                                    sister, Jenny.
                                    Now her life as a stay-at-home parent has left her feeling empty but not ungrateful
                                    for what she
                                    has. Jonah and Jenny eventually broke up, but years later they had a one-night stand
                                    and Jenny got
                                    pregnant with their son, Elijah. Now Jonah is back in town, engaged to Jenny, and
                                    working at the
                                    local high school as Clara’s teacher. Clara dreams of being an actress and has a
                                    crush on Miller,
                                    who plans to go to film school, but her father doesn't approve. It doesn’t help that
                                    Miller already
                                    has a jealous girlfriend who stalks him via text from college. But Clara and
                                    Morgan’s home life
                                    changes radically when Chris and Jenny are killed in an accident, revealing
                                    long-buried secrets and
                                    forcing Morgan to reevaluate the life she chose when early motherhood forced her
                                    hand. Feeling
                                    betrayed by the adults in her life, Clara marches forward, acting both responsible
                                    and rebellious as
                                    she navigates her teenage years without her father and her aunt, while Jonah and
                                    Morgan's relationship
                                    evolves in the wake of the accident. Front-loaded with drama, the story leaves
                                    plenty of room for the
                                    mother and daughter to unpack their feelings and decide what’s next.

                                <p>Award-winning author Reynolds (Look Both Ways, 2019, etc.) presents a young readers’
                                    version of
                                    American University professor Kendi’s (How To Be an Antiracist, 2019, etc.) Stamped
                                    From the
                                    Beginning (2016). This volume, which is “not a history book,” chronicles racist
                                    ideology,
                                    specifically anti-Blackness in the U.S., from its genesis to its pernicious

                                    ideology in the U.S. has consistently relied on the erronious belief that African

                                    other media, and pseudo-science. Using separationist, assimilationist, and

                                    figures, a direct line is drawn throughout U.S history from chattel slavery through
                                    the Civil War,
                                    Jim Crow, the civil rights era, the war on drugs, and #BlackLivesMatter, with plenty
                                    of little-known,
                                    compelling, and disturbing details inserted. Readers who want to truly understand
                                    how deeply embedded
                                    racism is in the very fabric of the U.S., its history, and its systems will come
                                    away educated and
                                    enlightened. It’s a monumental feat to chronicle in so few pages the history of not
                                    only anti-Black
                                    racism in the U.S., but also assimilationist and anti-racist thought as well. In the
                                    process it succeeds
                                    at connecting “history directly...to our lives as we live them right this minute.”
                                    Worthy of inclusion
                                    in every home and in curricula and libraries everywhere.

                                <p>In Kidd’s (The Invention of Wings, 2014, etc.) feminist take on the New Testament,
                                    Jesus has a wife
                                    whose fondest longing is to write. Ana is the daughter of Matthias, head scribe to
                                    Herod Antipas,
                                    tetrarch of Galilee. She demonstrates an exceptional aptitude for writing, and
                                    Matthias, for a time,
                                    indulges her with reed pens, papyri, and other 16 C.E. office supplies. Her mother
                                    disapproves, but
                                    her aunt, Yaltha, mentors Ana in the ways of the enlightened women of Alexandria,
                                    from whence Yaltha,
                                    suspected of murdering her brutal husband, was exiled years before. Yaltha was also
                                    forced to give
                                    up her daughter, Chaya, for adoption. As Ana reaches puberty, parental tolerance of
                                    her nonconformity
                                    wanes, outweighed by the imperative to marry her off. Her adopted brother,
                                    Judas—yes, that Judas—is s
                                    oon disowned for his nonconformity—plotting against Antipas. On the very day Ana,
                                    age 14, meets her
                                    prospective betrothed, the repellent Nathanial, in the town market, she also
                                    encounters Jesus, a young
                                    tradesman, to whom she’s instantly drawn. Their connection deepens after she
                                    encounters Jesus in the
                                    cave where she is concealing her writings about oppressed women. When Nathanial dies
                                    after his betrothal
                                    to Ana but before their marriage, Ana is shunned for insufficiently mourning him—and
                                    after refusing to
                                    become Antipas’ concubine, she is about to be stoned until Jesus defuses the
                                    situation with that famous
                                    admonition. She marries Jesus and moves into his widowed mother’s humble compound in
                                    Nazareth, accompanied
                                    by Yaltha. There, poverty, not sexism, prohibits her from continuing her
                                    writing—office supplies are
                                    expensive. Kidd skirts the issue of miracles, portraying Jesus as a fully human and,
                                    for the period,
                                    accepting husband—after a stillbirth, he condones Ana’s practice of herbal birth
                                    control. A structural
                                    problem is posed when Jesus’ active ministry begins—what will Ana’s role be? Problem
                                    avoided when, notified
                                    by Judas that Antipas is seeking her arrest, she and Yaltha journey to Alexandria in
                                    search of Chaya. In
                                    addition to depriving her of the opportunity to write the first and only
                                    contemporaneous gospel, removing
                                    Ana from the main action destroys the novel’s momentum.

                                    Benny Silva,
                                    a first-year teacher in tiny, impoverished Augustine, Louisiana working there for

                                    a way to pay off her student debts. Benny is young and enthusiastic, trying to

                                    Friends”
                                    advertisements that appeared in Southern newspapers after the Civil War, as newly
                                    freed slaves
                                    desperately searched for loved ones who had been sold away. Louisiana, 1875: In the
                                    tumultuous
                                    era of Reconstruction, three young women set off as unwilling companions on a
                                    perilous quest:
                                    Hannie, a freed slave; Lavinia, the pampered heir to a now destitute plantation; and
                                    Juneau Jane,
                                    Lavinia’s Creole half sister. Each carries private wounds and powerful secrets as
                                    they head for
                                    Texas, following roads rife with vigilantes and soldiers still fighting a war lost a
                                    decade before.
                                    For Lavinia and Juneau Jane, the journey is one of stolen inheritance and financial
                                    desperation,
                                    but for Hannie, torn from her mother and siblings before slavery’s end, the

                                    reignites an agonizing question: Could her long-lost family still be out there?
                                    Beyond the swamps
                                    lie the limitless frontiers of Texas and, improbably, hope. Louisiana, 1987: For

                                    Benedetta Silva, a subsidized job at a poor rural school seems like the ticket to

                                    is suspicious of new ideas and new people, and Benny can scarcely comprehend the
                                    lives of her
                                    poverty-stricken students. But amid the gnarled live oaks and run-down plantation
                                    homes lie the
                                    century-old history of three young women, a long-ago journey, and a hidden book that
                                    could change
                                    everything.

                                <p>Transcendent Kingdom is a deeply moving portrait of a family of Ghanaian immigrants
                                    ravaged by
                                    depression and addiction and grief—a novel about faith, science, religion, love.
                                    Exquisitely
                                    written, emotionally searing, this is an exceptionally powerful follow-up to Gyasi's
                                    phenomenal
                                    debut.

                                <p>A scientist weighs the big questions that her private trauma bequeaths her. After
                                    Homegoing (2016)
                                    swept through seven generations, Gyasi’s wise second novel pivots toward intimacy.
                                    It unspools
                                    entirely in the voice of watchful, reticent, brilliant Gifty, 28, nearly finished
                                    with her
                                    doctorate in neuroscience at Stanford’s School of Medicine. Her formidable mother, a
                                    home health
                                    care aide, has plummeted into a second severe depression, and their family pastor
                                    has dispatched
                                    the limp woman toward Gifty via airplane from Huntsville, Alabama, “folding her up
                                    the way you
                                    would a jumpsuit.” The first episode, when Gifty was 11, arrived after an opiate
                                    overdose stole
                                    the life of 16-year-old Nana, the firstborn son and more cherished child. Both times
                                    the Ghanaian
                                    matriarch has crawled mutely into bed, but this time not before asking adult Gifty
                                    if she still
                                    prays. “No,” says Gifty, who turns her ontological questions on lab mice. She gets
                                    them addicted
                                    to Ensure and then opens their brains surgically, probing the neural pathways of
                                    recklessness,
                                    looking for clues to creating restraint. Gifty hopes to apply her results to “the
                                    species Homo
                                    Sapiens, the most complex animal, the only animal who believed he had transcended
                                    his Kingdom,
                                    as one of my high school biology teachers used to say.” This work, Gifty insists,
                                    has zero to
                                    do with her brother’s death. In 54 microchapters and precise prose, Gyasi creates an
                                    ache of
                                    recognition, especially for readers knowledgeable about the wreckage of addiction.
                                    Still, she
                                    leavens this nonlinear novel with sly humor, much more than in Homegoing, as the
                                    daughter of a
                                    traditional woman weighs what it means to walk in the world not quite a nonbeliever.
                                    The author
                                    is astute about childhood grandiosity and a pious girl’s deep desire to be good; she
                                    conveys in
                                    brief strokes the notched, nodding hook of heroin’s oblivion. In its wake, adult
                                    Gifty sits with
                                    the limits of both bench science and evangelical Christianity. Nowhere does Gyasi
                                    take a cheap
                                    shot. Instead, she writes a final chapter that gives readers a taste of hard-won
                                    deliverance.

                                <p>A wallflower runs for prom queen. After being snubbed by her best friend, Jordan, in
                                    favor of his
                                    new football friends on the first day of high school, Liz Lighty felt acute shame
                                    about being
                                    herself and all the things that made her different: her height, being Black and
                                    queer, and not
                                    having enough money. She began wearing her hair pulled back, chose less colorful
                                    clothing, and did
                                    her best to blend in so no one would notice her. But now, as a senior, Liz has to
                                    put herself in
                                    the spotlight to secure her future. Because despite doing everything right—excellent
                                    grades, solid
                                    extracurriculars, and playing first-chair clarinet—she doesn’t win a much-needed
                                    scholarship at her
                                    dream school. When her brother convinces her that running for prom queen—with its
                                    $10,000 scholarship
                                    prize—is the answer, she enters the competition. The race for the crown gets
                                    complicated when Liz falls
                                    for one of the other competitors, Jordan tries to rekindle their friendship, and a
                                    friend urges her to
                                    change everything about herself in order to win. While the hullabaloo around prom
                                    seems far-fetched, the
                                    lead-up to the dance is pitch-perfect rom-com. Johnson does an excellent job of
                                    portraying the anxiety
                                    and internalized self-hatred from being different in a mostly White, affluent small
                                    town. Liz and Jordan
                                    are Black; supporting characters appear White by default.
